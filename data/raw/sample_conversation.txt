Friend: Hey, how's it going?
You: not much, just working on this ai project
Friend: That sounds cool! What does it do?
You: it's a discord bot that learns to talk like me
Friend: How does it work?
You: it uses my discord messages to learn my style
Friend: That's pretty impressive! Can it respond to questions too?
You: yeah that's the whole point
Friend: Will you make it public?
You: probably not, it's just for me
Friend: Fair enough. What other projects are you working on?
You: nothing much, just this one for now
Friend: Cool, let me know how it turns out
You: will do
